# Scryfall-API

Created this project to do some meddling with Scryfall's MTG APIs, as its my first dive into API integrations. 

I'd like to make a python program that simulates a simple Scryfall search program. 

Done using Python and Scryfall's API documentation here: https://scryfall.com/docs/api
